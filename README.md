## Introduction
This repository is intended to help you understand how  **Deep-learning** works by presenting you an implementation of them !
As a refresher , we will start by implementing some basic machine learning models like **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Soft-max Regression**.
We will implement the **model function, the cost function and the minimization function and gradient computation using _Stochastic Gradient Descent and Batch Gradient Descent_**
